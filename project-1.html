            Combining birds with its Chinese symbolism, I designed these two

            I decided to play into the idea of contrasting between misfortune
            and good luck because of China’s culture of auspiciousness. I chose
            a crow and red-crowned crane to represent these sides both because
            of the dichotomy of their appearances and because of their meaning
            in Chinese superstition.

            Crows are often associated with bad omens in Chinese culture,
            labeled as harbingers of misfortune. At this stage of my research, I
            was conceptualizing a former warrior still clinging on to their
            pride from the past, or a rogue/bandit character. I researched
            clothing average citizens might wear, tattered but appropriate for a
            quick getaway or scuffle on the streets. Conical hats are common in
            Asian countries to combat the sun, so I wanted to implement it into
            this rogue character that would be travelling around.

            The red-crowned crane is often associated with longevity, wisdom,
            peace and harmony in China. With these attributes, I immediately
            thought of an honourable and grand warrior. In my research, I found
            that the helmets of ancient China are often adorned with bird
            feathers at the top — fitting for my theme. Red and gold are both
            prominent colours of China, with the red symbolizing good fortune
            and gold symbolizing prosperity. I tried to keep these in mind as I
            was designing the character.

              In my thumbnailing and exploration phase, I played around with the
              ratio of human to bird, and how wings would translate on a human’s
              anatomy. Perhaps it would be attached to the arms, or coming from
              their back. I wanted to create an air of mystery into the crow’s
              design, so in some of the thumbnails I created a wide conical hat
              to hide his face partially. In my thumbnailing of the red-crowned
              crane hero, I was exploring different ideas between a grand
              warrior decorated heavily, or a more cunning and sleek design.

            In the conceptual sketch phase, this is where I was figuring out
            their personalities and body language. Because outlaws portrayed in
            media are always mysterious and stoic, I wanted to break the mold by
            making the rogue more mischievous and sly — he is a crow after all!
            In turn, to contrast his playfulness, I thought the red-crowned
            crane warrior being the more stoic and stern one would create an
            interesting dynamic between the two.

          made her compositions so successful. In many of her work, contrast and
          strong silhouettes were most prevalent. The ratio of her canvas’ are
          narrow, allowing for a more cinematic and clear focal point. In each
          work, there is a distinct foreground, middle ground, and background in
          which the further a subject is, the more faded it is painted.

            break down such a daunting task into something more simple.

            When I am in the line art stage, I always use heavier lines for the
            foreground and lighter ones as it gets further back to ease some
            tension off the viewer’s eyes.

          In this stage, I started trying to figure out the hierarchy of the
          piece using a darker foreground and transitioning to a lighter
          background. I coloured the composition in a grayscale to manage the
          layers more easily. I slowly applied base colours using a blue hue as
          the base colour.

        <h3>Lighting</h3>
        <div class="project-image-container">
          <img src="assets/project-1/rendering-phase-concept.jpg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <h4 class="project1-text2">
          Using the multiply layer, I started blocking off shadows and mapping
          out the lighting. This was the most difficult step of the process, as
          I had to test out how the light from the sky would bounce off every
          building and character. I used a strong rim light on the characters to
          bring them out even further.
